Quarantine retention period is 30 days

You can view, release, download, delete and report false positive quarantined email messages or files captured by Microsoft Defender for Office 365 (MDO) for SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business, and Microsoft Teams in Office 365. Keep messages in the quarantine for 30 days to allow enough time for further investigation. This is the default value and also the maximum.
