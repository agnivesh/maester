Safe Links is enabled intra-organization

Phishing attacks are not limited from external users. Commonly, when one user is compromised, that user can be used in a process of lateral movement between different accounts in your organization. Configuring Safe Links so that internal messages are also re-written can assist with lateral movement using phishing. The built-in policy is ignored in this check, as it only provides the minimum level of protection.
