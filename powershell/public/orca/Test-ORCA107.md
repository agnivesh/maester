End-user spam notification is enabled

Enable End-user Spam notifications to let users manage their own spam-quarantined messages (Release, Block sender, Review). End-user spam notifications contain a list of all spam-quarantined messages that the end-user has received during a time period. Policies that do not apply to a spam policy as either a spam, or bulk action, will appear disabled below.
