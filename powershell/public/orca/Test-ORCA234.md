Click through is disabled for Safe Documents

Safe Documents can assist protecting files opened in Office appplications. Before a user is allowed to trust a file opened in Office 365 ProPlus using Protected View, the file will be verified by Microsoft Defender for Office 365. It is possible to allow users click through Protected View even if Safe Documents identified the file as malicious. It is recommended to configure Safe Documents to not let users click through Pretected View.
